# Changelog

## v0.1 2013-09-29

* Tag added with the library starting to get some attention.  

Existing code is in pretty good shape but there is some work remaining.  Here's what I can think of off the top of my head:

* Implement remaining chapters.  There are just a few left.

* Change the API in a few places.  As packages from later chapters have
imported earlier ones, I've seen a few little things I'd like to go back and
change.  The biggest change will be for angle formatting.  I'll keep the
basic idea but allow more flexibility, probably at the expense of adding
some API methods.

* Add correctness tests in addition to the examples from the book.  This is
possible in many cases by drawing on sources outside the book.

* Review everything for consistency in style and naming.  I learned a few
things as I went along and some of the earlier packages need updates.
